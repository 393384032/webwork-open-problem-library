Suppose that the following information is known about a function \(f\):  the graph 
of its derivative, \(y = f'(x)\), is given in the figure below.  Further, assume that 
\(f'\) is piecewise linear (as pictured) and that for \(x \le 0\) and \(x \ge 6\), \(f'(x) = 0\).  
Finally, it is given that \(f(0) = 1\).

The total distance \(D\) should equal the area under the curve.
The best approximation is given by \(U\), because each rectangle has some area
above the curve to balance out the area that is missing below the curve. All of
the rectangles of \(S\) fall below the curve, while those of \(T\) all go above
the curve.
