As we begin to investigate ways to approximate definite integrals, it will be 
insightful to compare results to integrals whose exact values we know.  To that end, 
the following sequence of questions centers on \(\int_0^3 x^2 \, dx\).
$PAR
(a) Use the applet at \(\href{http://gvsu.edu/s/a9}{\texttt{http://gvsu.edu/s/a9}}\) with 
the function \(f(x) = x^2\) on the window of \(x\) values from \(0\) to \(3\) to compute 
\(L_3\), the left Riemann sum with three subintervals. $BR
\{ essay_box(1,25) \}
$PAR
(b) Likewise, use the applet to compute \(R_3\) and \(M_3\), the right and middle Riemann 
sums with three subintervals, respectively. $BR
\{ essay_box(1,25) \}
$PAR
(c) Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to compute the exact value of 
\(I = \int_0^3 x^2 \, dx\). $BR
\{ essay_box(1,25) \}
$PAR
(d) We define the error in an approximation of a definite integral to be the difference 
between the integral's exact value and the approximation's value.  What is the error 
that results from using \(L_3\)? From \(R_3\)?  From \(M_3\)? $BR
\{ essay_box(1,25) \}
$PAR
(e) In what follows in this section, we will learn a new approach to estimating the 
value of a definite integral known as the Trapezoid Rule.  The basic idea is to use 
trapezoids, rather than rectangles, to estimate the area under a curve.  What is the 
formula for the area of a trapezoid with bases of length \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) and height \(h\)? $BR
\{ essay_box(1,25) \}
$PAR
(f) Working by hand, estimate the area under \(f(x) = x^2\) on \([0,3]\) using three 
subintervals and three corresponding trapezoids.  What is the error in this approximation?  
How does it compare to the errors you calculated in (d)? $BR
