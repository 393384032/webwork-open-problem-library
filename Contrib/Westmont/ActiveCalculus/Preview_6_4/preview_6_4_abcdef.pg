A bucket is being lifted from the bottom of a 50-foot deep well; its weight (including the water), \(B\), in pounds at a height \(h\) feet above the water is given by the function \(B(h)\).  When the bucket leaves the water, the bucket and water together weigh \(B(0) = 20\) pounds, and when the bucket reaches the top of the well, \(B(50) = 12\) pounds.  Assume that the bucket loses water at a constant rate (as a function of height, \(h\)) throughout its journey from the bottom to the top of the well.
$PAR
(a) Find a formula for \(B(h)\). $BR

$PAR
(b) Compute the value of the product \(B(5) \triangle h\), where \(\triangle h = 2\) feet. Include units on your answer.  Explain why this product represents the approximate work it took to move the bucket of water from \(h = 5\) to \(h = 7\). $BR

$PAR
(c) Is the value in (b) an over- or under-estimate of the actual amount of work it took to move the bucket from \(h = 5\) to \(h = 7\)?  Why? $BR

$PAR
(d) Compute the value of the product \(B(22) \triangle h\), where \(\triangle h = 0.25\) feet.  Include units on your answer.  What is the meaning of the value you found? $BR

$PAR
(e) More generally, what does the quantity \(W_{\mbox{\small{slice}}} = B(h) \triangle h\) measure for a given value of \(h\) and a small positive value of \(\triangle h\)? $BR
