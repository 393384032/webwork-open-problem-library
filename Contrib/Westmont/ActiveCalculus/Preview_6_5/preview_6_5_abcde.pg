A company with a large customer base has a call center that receives thousands of calls a day.  After studying the data that represents how long callers wait for assistance, they find that the function \(p(t) = 0.25e^{-0.25t}\) models the time customers wait in the following way:  the fraction of customers who wait between \(t = a\) and \(t = b\) minutes is given by
\[\int_a^b p(t) \, dt.\]
Use this information to answer the following questions.
$PAR
(a) Determine the fraction of callers who wait between 5 and 10 minutes. $BR

$PAR
(b) Determine the fraction of callers who wait between 10 and 20 minutes. $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
(c) Next, let's study how the fraction who wait up to a certain number of minutes:
$BR
	(i) What is the fraction of callers who wait between 0 and 5 minutes? $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
	(ii) What is the fraction of callers who wait between 0 and 10 minutes? $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
	(iii) Between 0 and 15 minutes?  Between 0 and 20?  $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
(d) Let \(F(b)\) represent the fraction of callers who wait between \(0\) and \(b\) minutes.  Find a formula for \(F(b)\) that involves a definite integral, and then use the First FTC to find a formula for \(F(b)\) that does not involve a definite integral. $BR
\{ essay_box(4,60) \}
$PAR
(e) What is the value of \(\displaystyle \lim_{b \to \infty} F(b)\)?  Why? $BR
