Is it possible to plan a round trip (on land) through the countries of Latvia,
Lithuania, Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine that
visits each country exactly once? Is there more than one way to plan such a
trip?

$PAR SOLUTION $PAR
Answers may vary. A possible round-trip that visits each country exactly once
is: $BR
Latvia -> Lithuania -> Poland -> Slovakia -> Ukraine -> Belarus -> Latvia
$BR
Any other round trip would have to be the same, except for direction and
starting point (Why?). It is impossible to plan a round-trip visiting each
border crossing exactly once, but a possible one-way trip is: $BR
Lithuania -> Latvia -> Belarus -> Lithuania -> Poland -> Belarus -> Ukraine ->
Poland -> Slovenia -> Ukraine.
