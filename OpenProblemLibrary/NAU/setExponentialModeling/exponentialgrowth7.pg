The population of the world in 1987 was 5 billion and the growth rate was estimated at $a percent per year. Assume that the
population follows an exponential growth model of the form \(A=A_0(1+r)^{t}\). Find the projected world
population in $y. Give your answer in terms of billions of people.
$BR
Your answer is \{ans_rule(20) \} billion
