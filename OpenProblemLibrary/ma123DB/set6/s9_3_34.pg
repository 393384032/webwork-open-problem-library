A tank contains \($a\) L of pure water.  A solution that contains \($b\) kg of sugar per liter enters a tank at the rate \($c\) L/min The solution is mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate. $BR$BR

$BBOLD a.) $EBOLD How much sugar is in the tank initially? $BR

Answer:  \{ans_rule(40) \} (kg) $BR$BR

$BBOLD b.) $EBOLD Find the amount of sugar in the tank after \(t\)  minutes. $BR

amount =  \{ ans_rule(40) \} $BR
$BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Your answer should be a function of \(t\). $BR$BR



$BBOLD c.) $EBOLD Find the concentration of sugar in the solution in 
the tank after $d minutes.
$BR
concentration =  \{ ans_rule(40) \} $BR
