BEGIN_PGML
A water pump is used to pump water from one large reservoir to another large reservoir that is at a higher elevation. The free surfaces of both reservoirs are exposed to atmospheric pressure, as sketched in Fig. [xx]. The dimensions and minor loss coefficients are provided in the figure. The pump's performance is approximated by the expression H_available = H_0 - a (dV/dt)^2, where the shutoff head H_0 = [a] m of water column, coefficient a = [b] m/(Lpm)^2, available pump head H_available is in units of meters of water column, and capacity (dV/dt) is in units of liters per minute (Lpm). Estimate the capacity delivered by the pump.  Use the turbulent pipe flow friction factor equation given on the MECH 222F Formula Sheet.
